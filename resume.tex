\runsubsection{\href{http://www.moat.com/}{Moat}}
    \location{\hfill May 2012 – Present}
    \descript{Software Developer}
    \begin{tightemize}
        \item
            Developed the full-stack behind Moat Pro, an enterprise
            ad-intelligence platform that allows markets to research trends
            in the online advertising industry.
        \item
            Developed network of autonomous web crawlers (Moatbots) capable
            of programmatically detecting, capturing, and indexing online
            advertisements.
        %\item
            %Extended Moatbots to index rich-media advertisements in
            %addition to traditional Standard IAB formats.
        %\item
            %Extended Moatbots to include regional indexing capabilities,
            %e.g.- develop a representation of the UK ad landscape by
            %proxying traffic through UK servers.
        \item
            Developed ETL for consuming warehoused Moatbot data and
            transforming it into an optimized, queryable form.
        %\item
            %Refactored ETL to aggregate indexed results across different
            %regions.
        \item
            Developed API to cache architecture for client side report
            generation and Pyramid application to serve reports.
        \item
            Developed autocomplete service for web application that served
            as the primary means of directing site traffic.
        \item
            Developed Pyramid middleware for logging user engagement with
            the client-facing brand intelligence tool.
        \item
            Developed homebrew real-time analytics tool for consuming
            engagement data to build reports on site usage patterns and
            behaviour.
        \item
            Deployed a Jenkins continuous integration server for
            regression testing.
        \item
            Developed homebrew heterogeneous server role and configuration
            deployment system in Amazon’s EC2.

    \descript{Linux Infrastructure Consultant}
    \begin{tightemize}
        \item
            Lead undergrad consultant at the Laboratory for Elementary-
            Particle Physics.
        \item
            Designed, installed, and serviced solutions for a network of
            high-performance computational nodes used in the study of beams
            and accelerators, photon science, and particle physics.
        \item
            Managed a complex network of heterogeneous Linux nodes
            responsible for serving the department’s administrative tasks.

\section{Research}
    \runsubsection{Cornell Robot Learning Lab}
        \location{\hfill Jan 2011 – Mar 2011}
        \descript{Undergraduate Researcher}
            Worked with \custombold{\href{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asaxena/}{
            Prof. Ashutosh Saxena}} to create a supervised learning algorithm
            for finding good object placements using point-clouds of an object
            and its surrounding area. Implemented the algorithm on an Adept
            Viper s850 robotic arm equipped with a Microsoft Kinect. SVM models
            built from our training examples attained performances in excess of
            80\% for both precision and recall on both flat and non-flat
            surface placement.
